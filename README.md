# 105-Unit-3
This is a repository containing data and a curated subset from an online database for Professor Gotzler's Fall 2024 section of Engl 105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

**The repository contains the raw data set and the subset of data that was created by manipulating the raw data using Python3 and  the Pandas package for data analysis.**
>The repository also includes the Python notebook that documents the process for crafting the subset of data from the original data.



The dataset is derived from the **[United States Environmental Protection Agency website.](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting)**
> The data provided on this website is formatted differently than the data provided in this repository, but no values were altered. This was done to ensure the data could be easily displayed and referenced when manipulating it with Python3.

This data may be used by climate scientists or individuals interested in learning about air emissions in 2021.
